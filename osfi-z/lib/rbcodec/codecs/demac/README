demac - a decoder for Monkey's Audio files.

Introduction

demac is an implementation in portable ANSI C of a decoder for the
Monkey's Audio lossless compression format.  It has the following
features:

  * Open source (GNU GPL)
  * Written in portable ANSI C
  * Designed for use on low memory and embedded devices.  All internal
    buffers are statically declared - the core library doesn't require 
    malloc/free.  This has the disadvantage that the library isn't 
    re-entrant.


Compatibility


libdemac is still in the early stages of development but has been
relatively well tested with v3.99 files at all compression levels.

v3.97 files have received less testing - 16-bit files seem to work,
but 24-bit files are causing problems in the range decoder.

Files earlier than v3.97 are not supported by libdemac, but support
might be added in the future.


Source Code

The source code in this directory is structured as follows:

demac/Makefile - Makefile for the standalone demac decoder
demac/demac.c - Simple standalone test program to decoder an APE file to WAV
demac/wavwrite.[ch] - Helper functions for demac.c
demac/libdemac/Makefile - A Makefile for use in Rockbox
demac/libdemac/*.[ch] - The main libdemac code


Latest Version

The latest version of demac and libdemac can always be found in the
"lib/rbcodec/codecs/demac/" directory in the Rockbox source.  You can check
this out from svn with the command:

svn co svn://svn.rockbox.org/rockbox/trunk/lib/rbcodec/codecs/demac demac
