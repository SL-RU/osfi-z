Library: libspeex-1.2beta3 (SVN version 14054)
Imported: 2007-03-12 by Dan Everton


This directory contains a local version of libspeex for decoding Ogg/Speex
audio streams. 


LICENSING INFORMATION

Speex is available under the terms of the Xiph.Org variant of the BSD
license, which is both an open source and free software license. The
license is described in the COPYING file in this directory.


IMPORT DETAILS

The .[ch] files from speex/libspeex/ and speex/include/ were imported 
into Rockbox.  This includes the test files. Some hackery was done to
the include files so that they #include properly when built in Rockbox.

A simple config-speex.h file was added to enable libspeex's fixed-point
integer-only mode and to specify the endianness of the target CPU. Also,
ARM specific optimisations were enabled.

Since some parts of Speex still rely on <math.h> functions, a simple 
include was created to get these parts to compile. Stub functions can be
found in rockbox.c in this directory.
