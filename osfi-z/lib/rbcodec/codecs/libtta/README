TTA Hardware Players Library
============================

Version 1.2, (c) 2004 Alexander Djourik. All rights reserved.

* Introduction

This library provides to decode a multichannel 8,16 and 24
bits TTA audio files. TTA is a lossless audio format. Being
"lossless" means that no data/quality is lost in the compression
- when uncompressed, the data will be identical to the original.
The compression ratios of TTA depend on the type of music file
being compressed, but the compression size will generally range
between 30% - 70% of the original.

TTA format supports both of ID3v1/v2 tags. Detailed format
description is available at http://www.true-audio.com.

The decoder process has a minimal system requirements and does
not required to create a big additional memory pools. As the
TTA algorithms has a same system requirements both for decoding
and for encoding processes - the TTA recorder can be easily
realized also.
