Players Zishan Z1 and Z2 are great: cheap, good HIFI sounding and awesome! Buut... they don't have display, equalizer, playlist, music chooser and other important stuff. I'm intended to implement all that features!

For developing I'll use:
- Zishan Z1 
- Cheap chinese 0.96 oled on ssd1306
- Cheap st-link debugger
- My own GUI library: https://github.com/SL-RU/MakiseGUI
- Some of parts of [Rockbox project](https://www.rockbox.org/) code (codecs and DSP).
- HM-10 bluetooth module

## Planned features:
- Graphical gui to control player
- Bluetooth for control from smartphone
- Graphic equalizer
- Playlist creator
- Random play without repeats
- Custom key remapping
- USB DAC
- audiobook reader

For the start i'm need that things:
- ✔️ Zishan Z1 (thanks to sergzver85)
- ✔️ Zishan Z2 (thanks to evgenkent8)
- ...
